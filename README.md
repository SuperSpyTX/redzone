## Redzone

A _work in progress_ memory management library (42's malloc project) designed with an strange and awesome data structure
(Red Black Tree).  It is also an memory debugger for debugging C programs (**not yet implemented**) (and 42 projects alike).

All in progress notes on the design can be found [here](blob/master/includes/redzone/internal.h).
